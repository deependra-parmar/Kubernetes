Service is used to expose the application at different levels and extents. Services help us to connect and establish communication between different running pods.

Types: clusterIP, NodePort, Loadbalancer, etc.

targetPort: port on which the application is listening in the pods
nodePort: port of clusterIP on which application is exposed
port: internal port for service
