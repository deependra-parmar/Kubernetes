Environments can be passed directly in the yaml in spec.containers.env but when the application grows and you need to use the env's repeatedly, seperation of concern is important.

Values of configMap variables can be changed but you need to force the operation.

POD.YAML ----> DIFFERENT ENV's INDIVIDUALLY
POD2.YAML ---> GIVING REFERENCE OF configMap

--------------------

Imperative creation of configmap

    kubectl create cm <name_of_CM> --from-literal=firstname=deependra \ --from-literal=lastname=parmar
